Yes 8 can be placed there. Since there are 8s in column 7 and column 8 column there must be an 8 in column 9 as well. However it can only be in the grid in the bottom corner as other grids already have 8. Now in that grid, due to the constraints on it by 8 in column 7 and column 8 we can have 8 only in one position i.e. the square mentioned.

Yes, this suggests a general strategy that the domain of a square can be reduced by elimating those values occur in the same row, column and grid.

For solving the diabolical sudoku, first I will try solving it logically which is the method mentioned in the previous question. If that fails, I will have to guess the values which have been finalized. Taking a particular value into consideration, I can then try solving the sudoku. If the problem isnt solved then try guessing another value till you get a solution.
